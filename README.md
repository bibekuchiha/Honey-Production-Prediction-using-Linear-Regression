# Honey-Production-Prediction-using-Linear-Regression
As you may have already heard, the honeybees are in a precarious state right now. You may have seen articles about the decline of the honeybee population for various reasons. You want to investigate this decline and how the trends of the past predict the future for the honeybees.


We have dataset about honey production in the United States from Kaggle from 1998 to 2012. It is called df and has the following columns:

* state
*   numcol
*   yieldpercol
*  totalprod
*   stocks
*   priceperlb
* prodvalue
* year

Note : we only care about the total production of honey per year in this notebook.
